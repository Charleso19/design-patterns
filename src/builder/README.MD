# Builder Pattern

### Builder pattern notes:
- Good for construction of objects that may contain a lot of parameters. 
- Good for when we want to make the object immutable, once weâ€™re done constructing it.

- Telescoping constructors are constructors that deal with each parameter variation and default values: https://www.vojtechruzicka.com/avoid-telescoping-constructor-pattern/#:~:text=As%20a%20workaround%2C%20a%20technique,values%20for%20the%20extra%20parameters.
- Telescoping constructors are immutable but is inflexible.
- JavaBean convention is more flexible, but it is mutable via the setters! It is also unclear what the contract should be for valid construction.

- Not suitable if you want an object that is mutable.
- Typically used with inner static class, but can use an external builder too (https://gist.github.com/vojtechruz/3162a7e5525d242e50935e93149208a1)
- Not typically refactored in after the fact, it is typically designed first.
- Can be a bit involved to implement as it can be achieved with constructors via telescoping constructors.
